MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
"I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I have some experience with javascript. 
Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover Variables and basic data types, Conditionals (if/elif/else),
 Loops (for and while),Functions, Basic list operations1'"

PROBLEM 1: Variables & Data Types
"Create variables to store your name (string), age (integer), and height in meters (float). Then print a sentence like:
My name is Alice, I am 16 years old and 1.7 meters tall."

name = "Alice"
age = 16
height = 1.7

Problem 2: Conditionals (if/elif/else)
"Write a function grade_score(score) that
takes a test score (0 to 100) and returns the grade as follows:"

90 or above: "A"

80 to 89: "B"

70 to 79: "C"

60 to 69: "D"

Below 60: "F"
