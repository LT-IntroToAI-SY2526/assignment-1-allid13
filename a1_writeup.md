# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?

My initial experience with Python seemed very challenging and difficult. I was used to javascript and going all through summer without using any kind of programming language made this even more challenging. I was trying to remember how to do some functions with javascript and see how they compared to python and although it did help, it was a little challenging at first. Over these past few days where I have been using python more and more often, I have been able to get more used to it and familiar with it. It seems to be a little easier than javascript so I am confident that I’ll be an expert on Python by the end of the year.


2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
I used AI quite a lot trying to compare Java to Python and it really did help with comparisons. I used the techniques that we learn in the earlier assignments about how to build good prompts so that we can get the answers that we need and want. So I was very specific on parts where I was confused and asked for help. Some examples were something like “Can you give me an example of a for loop function in python that is easily interpreted by a student who is mostly familiar with javascript and is trying to get used to working with python.” From these responses it really helped me to understand and be more comfortable with Python.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
I didn't really have a concept that I struggled with a lot but if I had to choose one it would be the while loopsand the for loops. I tried to work on it on my own but the format seemed to be the most different than any other compared to java. I was trying to figure out how to put a for loop inside a while loop but it seemed like it was difficult to manage the two and seperate their codes to work on the output that it gave me.

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
I really took advantage of using code hs because I was already really familiar with the way that it worked from when I did projects with Java. It really really helped me familiarise myself with Python and the main strategy that I used was writing the code that I needed in Javascript and then I would look into the documentation of Python and follow along with the rules and rewrite my code with the functions of the new language and since it was all pretty familiar, I didn’t really struggle. But without the use of the document in code hs, I am not sure how I would have been able to complete this task. I could of also asked AI for help with hints on how to do certain functions rather than just asking it to give me the solutions to all the problems.
